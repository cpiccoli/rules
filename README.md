This repository contains the set of rule files and related assets that are discussed in C. Piccoli 2018 (in press). Visualizing cityscapes of Classical antiquity: From early modern reconstruction drawings to 3D digital 3D models. Oxford: Archaeopress. The rule set has been developed to create a more intuitive GIS-driven symbology of (architectural) survey finds and to create alternative reconstruction hypotheses of the 4th century BC urban layout of Koroneia (Boeotia, Central Greece)

Rule for GIS-driven symbology: 
The rule file "Scale-StoneTypeShp.cga" for GIS-driven symbology (see Piccoli 2018, 228-32) is associated with zipped folders: assets_1 and models_1. 

Rule for (late) Classical Greek architecture and street network:
The rule file "Individual_houses_slope.cga" for the generation of (late) Classical Greek domestic architecture and the rule "streets-steps.cga" are associated with the zipped folder assets_2. An example of a procedurally modelled house can be found at https://sketchfab.com/models/796866cb0bd541c083ff82c61b0cff56.

Important! After downloading the folders, change their names to 'assets' and 'models' in order to guarantee the proper relation with the rule file.
