## CityEngine rule set for GIS-driven symbology of survey finds and (late) Classical Greek architecture 
This repository contains the set of rule files and related assets compiled in CityEngine and made available as complementary material for **C. Piccoli 2018 (in press).<a href="http://archaeopress.com/ArchaeopressShop/Public/displayProductDetail.asp?id=%7b3E4846F9-77FD-4A15-A264-24267D731E58%7d"> *Visualizing cityscapes of Classical antiquity: From early modern reconstruction drawings to 3D digital 3D models*</a>. Oxford: Archaeopress**. The rule set has been developed to create a more intuitive GIS-driven symbology of (architectural) survey finds and to create alternative reconstruction hypotheses of the 4th century BC urban layout of Koroneia in Boeotia, Central Greece (the 3D urban model can be viewed <a href="https://jbvklink.home.xs4all.nl/cpiccoli/webviewer/viewer.html?3dWebScene=../webscenes/Koroneia.3ws"> here </a> - WebGL required). This rule set is distributed for research and educational purposes.

### Rule for GIS-driven symbology: 
The rule file "Scale-StoneTypeShp.cga" for GIS-driven symbology (see Piccoli 2018, 228-32) is associated with zipped folders: assets_1 and models_1. The rule file has been used to obtain a more intuitive insight into clusters of architectural survey finds (Piccoli 2018, fig. 6.3, p. 229):

### Rule for (late) Classical Greek architecture and street network:
The rule file "Individual_houses_slope.cga" for the generation of (late) Classical Greek domestic architecture and the rule "streets-steps.cga" are associated with the zipped folder assets_2. Examples of houses procedurally modelled using this rule include (Piccoli 2018, fig. 6.14, p. 239):

(see also a model of a house on <a href="https://sketchfab.com/models/796866cb0bd541c083ff82c61b0cff56">SketchFab</a>).

### Important! 
After downloading the folders, change their names to 'assets' and 'models' in order to guarantee the proper relation with the rule file.
